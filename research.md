## Inspiration from Solarized

16 colors, (eight monotones, eight accent colors).

Try to retain the selective contrast relationships and accented colors when switching contrast modes.

Gives name to each color.

Lists colors in these forms: ```HEX     16/8 TERMCOL  XTERM/HEX   L*A*B      RGB         HSB```

## Ideas

Inspration from real world and good reading experiences. Should be engaging.

Dark and light theme.

Modern. Fuck compatibility.

Inspired by good notebooks? Moleskin, Leuchtturm 1917 etc.
